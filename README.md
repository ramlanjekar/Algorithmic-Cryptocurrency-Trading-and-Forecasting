# Algorithmic-Cryptocurrency-Trading-and-Forecasting
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and analyze a cryptocurrency trading strategy using a combination of technical indicators, backtesting, and machine learning models. The approach integrates rule-based trading strategies with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictions to improve decision-making in dynamic cryptocurrency markets.

## Key Features

- **Phase 1**: A rule-based trading strategy utilizing indicators such as EMA, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, with backtesting to evaluate performance.
- **Phase 2**: Optimized trading strategy combining multiple indicators (EMA, Bollinger Bands, ATR) and enhanced decision-making via parameter tuning.
- **Phase 3**: Incorporation of LSTM-based time-series forecasting to predict future price movements and complement the rule-based system.

## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to explore how machine learning and traditional technical analysis can be combined to create more effective and adaptable cryptocurrency trading strategies. 

By combining rule-based strategies with predictive modeling, the project aims to develop a hybrid approach that can better navigate the volatility of cryptocurrency markets.

## Performance Metrics (Phase 2)

- **Return**: 279.41%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.54
- **Win Rate**: 60.39%
- **Max Drawdown**: -97.85%

## Future Work

- Further tuning of the LSTM model to improve prediction accuracy.
- Integration of the LSTM predictions with the rule-based strategy to create a hybrid trading model for more robust decision-making.
